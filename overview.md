# CORD Guide

This is a curated set of documents that describe how to install, operate, test,
and develop [CORD](https://www.opennetworking.org/cord/).
The material is organized in two parts:

* *Guides:* Outlines the process of installing, operating, testing and
   developing for CORD as a whole.

* *References:* Definitions and specifications about individual
   components that make up CORD.

CORD is a community-based open source project. In addition to this guide, you
can find information about this community, its projects, and its governance on
the [CORD wiki](https://wiki.opencord.org). This includes early white papers
and design notes that have shaped [CORD's
architecture](https://wiki.opencord.org/display/CORD/Documentation).

## Navigating the Guides

The guides are organized around the major stages in the lifecycle of CORD:

* [Installation](README.md): Installing (and later upgrading) CORD.
* [Operations](operating_cord/operating_cord.md): Operating an already
  installed CORD deployment.
* [Development](developer/developer.md): Developing new functionality
  to be included in CORD.
* [Testing](cord-tester/README.md): Testing functionality to be
 included in CORD.

These are all fairly obvious. What's less obvious is the relationship among
these stages, which is explained in [Navigating CORD](navigate.md).

## Navigating the References

CORD is built from disaggregated components that are assembled into a
composite solution. The References are organized accordingly:

* [Profile Reference](profiles/intro.md): Installation and
  configuation details for specific solutions built using CORD
  components.
* [Service Reference](operating_cord/services.md): Configuration
   (TOSCA) and modeling (xproto) definitions for individual CORD
   components.
* [Helm Refernce](charts/helm.md): Helm charts used to install
   individual CORD components.

For more information on the relationship between Profiles and
Services, see [Navigating CORD](navigate.md).

## Making Changes to this Document

The [http://guide.opencord.org](http://guide.opencord.org) website is built
using the legacy GitBook Toolchain (deprecated, docs unavailable), with the
documentation root in
[docs](https://github.com/opencord/docs/) in a
checked out source tree.  It is build with `make`, and requires that `gitbook`,
`python`, and a few other tools are installed.

Source for individual guides is available in the [CORD code
repository](https://gerrit.opencord.org); look in the `docs` directory of each
project, with the documentation rooted in the top-level `/docs`
directory. Updates and improvements to this documentation can be
submitted through Gerrit.
