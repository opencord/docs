# Hardware Requirements

A CORD POD is built using the following hardware components.

## Generic Hardware Guidelines

* **Compute Machines**: CORD canin principle be deployed on any x86
  machine, either physical or virtual. For development, demos or lab
  trials you may want to use only one machine (even your laptop could
  be fine, as long as it has enough resources). For more realistic
  deployments, we suggest using at least three machines (preferably
  all the same). The characteristics of these machines depends several
  factors. At the very minimum, each machine should have a 4 cores
  CPU, 32GB of RAM, and 100G of disk capacity. More sophisticated
  use-cases, for example COMAC, require more resources (see below).

* **Network Cards**: For whatever server use, it should have at the
  very minimum a 1G network interface for management.

* **Fabric Switches**: Fabric switches should be compatible with the
  ONOS Trellis application that controls them. We strongly recommend
  using one of the tested models suggested. 10G switches are usually
  preferred for initial functional tests and lab deployments since
  they are less expensive. Moreover, 10G ports can be usually
  downgraded to 1G speed, and it's possible to connect them using
  copper SFPs. The number of switches largely depends by your needs.
  For basic scenarios one may be enough. For more complete fabric
  tests, we recommend at least four switches. Developers sometimes
  emulate the fabric in software (e.g., using Mininet), but this applies
  only to specific use-cases.

* **Access Devices**: At the moment, SEBA and COMAC work
  with very specific access devices, as described below. We strongly
  recommend using these tested devices.

* **Optics and Cabling**: Some hardware may be picky about the optics.
  Both optics and cable models tested by the community are provided below.

* **Other**: In addition to the above, you will need a
  development/management machine and an L2 management swich to
  connect things together. Usually a laptop is enough for the former,
  and a legacy L2 switch is enough for the latter.
