For information on how to install `helm` please refer to
[Installing Helm](../prereqs/helm.md).

## CORD Helm Charts

All helm charts used to install CORD can be found in the `helm-chart`
repository. Most of the top-level directories in that repository
(e.g., `onos`, `voltha`, `xos-core`) correspond to components of
CORD that can be installed independently. For example, it is possible
to bring up `onos` without `voltha`, and vice versa. You can also
bring up XOS by itself (`xos-core`) or XOS with its GUI (`xos-core`
and `xos-gui`). This can be useful if you want to work on just the
CORD data models, without any backend components.

The `xos-services` and `xos-profiles` directories contain helm
charts for individual services and profiles (a mesh of services),
respectively. While it is possible to use Helm to bring up an
individual service, collections of related services are typically
installed as a unit; we call this unit a *profile.* Looking in the
`xos-profiles` directory, `rcord-lite` is an example profile. It
corresponds to R-CORD, and inspecting its `requirements.yaml`
file shows that it, in turn, depends on the `volt` and `vrouter`
services, among several others.

Some of the profiles bring up sub-systems that other profiles then
build upon. For example, `base-openstack` brings up three platform
related services (`onos-service`, `openstack`, and `vtn-service`),
which effectively provisions CORD to support OpenStack-based VNFs.
Once the services in the `base-openstack` profile are running, it
is then possible to bring up the `mcord` profile, which corresponds
to ~10 other services. It is also possible to bring up an individual
service by executing its helm chart; for example
`xos-services/simpleexampleservice`.

> **Note:** Sometimes we install Individual services by first
> "wrapping" them in a profile. For example,
> `SimpleExampleService` is deployed from the
> `xos-profiles/demo-simpleexampleservice` profile, rather
> than directly from `xos-services/simpleexampleservice`.
> The latter is included by reference from the former.
> This is not a fundamental limitation, but we do it when we
> want to run the `tosca-loader` that loads a TOSCA workflow
> into CORD. This feature is currently available at only
> the profile level.

Similarly, the `base-kubernetes` profile brings up Kubernetes in
support of container-based VNFs. This corresponds to the
`kubernetes-service`, not to be confused with CORD's use of
Kubernetes to deploy the CORD control plane. Once this profile is
running, it is possible to bring up an example VNF in a container
by executing its helm chart; for example
`xos-profiles/demo-simpleexampleservice`.

> **Note:** The `base-kubernetes` configuration does not yet
> incorporate VTN. Doing so is work-in-progress.

Finally, note that the `templates` sub-directory in both the
`xos-services` and `xos-profiles` directories includes one or
more TOSCA-related files. These play a role in configuring the
service graph and provisioning the individual services contained
in that service graph. This happens once the helm charts have
done their job, and is technically a post-install operation, as
discussed in the [Operations Guide](../operating_cord/operating_cord.md).

### Download the helm-charts Repository

You can get the CORD helm charts by cloning the `helm-charts` repository:

```shell
git clone https://gerrit.opencord.org/helm-charts
```

> **Note:** If you have downloaded the CORD code following the [Getting the Source
> Code](../developer/getting_the_code.md) guide, you'll find it in
> `~/cord/helm-charts`.

**IMPORTANT: All the helm commands needs to be executed from within this directory**

### Add the CORD Repository to Helm

If you don't want to download the repository, you can make the charts available
to helm by adding the repo to the list of repos it can obtain charts from:

```shell
helm repo add cord https://charts.opencord.org/master
helm repo update
```

If you decide to follow this route, you have to use the repo name (in this case
`cord`) with a prefix ( `cord/`) to specify which repo to obtain a chart from.

For example:

```shell
helm install -n xos-core xos-core
```

would become:

```shell
helm install -n xos-core cord/xos-core
```

## Overriding chart values

Occasionally you may need to [override and customize the default
settings](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing)
of a chart.

This is done using a "values file", and is done most frequently during
development or when customizing a deployment.

Development-specific and deployment example values files can be found in the
[helm-charts/examples](https://gerrit.opencord.org/plugins/gitiles/helm-charts/+/refs/heads/master/examples/)
directory.

### Specifying a Docker registry

Most charts specify a global value for the address of a Docker image registry.
By default this is blank, assuming that images will be pulled from the global
hub.docker.com registry:

```yaml
global:
  registry: ''
```

This would be overridden as follows - make sure to include the trailing `/`
character to separate the registry from the name of the container:

```yaml
global:
  registry: '10.90.0.101:30500/'
```

Note that using setting this value with change the registry setting for every
image in a chart.

To handle building and pushing images to a registry, see the [development
documentation](../developer/workflows/local.md#pushing-changes-to-a-remote-registry).

If you want to change only the registry for one specific image, the easiest way
is to modify the `repository` setting - for example:

```yaml
images:
  xos_gui:
    repository: 'xosproject/xos-gui'
    tag: '2.1.0'
    pullPolicy: 'Always'

  xos_ws:
    repository: 'xosproject/xos-ws'
    tag: '2.0.0'
    pullPolicy: 'Always'

global:
  registry: ''
```

You would modify the `repository` value for the specific image, but not the
global `registry` value:

```yaml
images:
  xos_gui:
    repository: '10.90.0.101:30500/xosproject/xos-gui'
    tag: '2.1.0'
    pullPolicy: 'Always'

  xos_ws:
    repository: 'xosproject/xos-ws'
    tag: '2.0.0'
    pullPolicy: 'Always'

global:
  registry: ''
```
